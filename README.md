# MedicationApp
The Medication Reminder App is an application that helps users stay on track of their medical calendar and reminds them of the pills they must take on a day to day basis. 

This project is a part of the Mobile Systems Development paper (COMP826) at AUT. 

## Instructions
Prerequisites: 
Install 'Expo client' app on your phone if you would like to try run the application on a real smart phone.
Otherwise, ensure you have an android studio simulator or an iOS simulator from XCode. 

Below are the instructions to compile the code:

 - Clone the repository (https://github.com/ehsaasgrover/MedicationApp/) into your IDE of choice OR open the project within your IDE of choice
 - Open terminal within the project root and type the following:

`npm i -g expo-cli`

`npm start`

An Expo client browser should open up, do not close this. 
According to the instructions provided in the terminal window, choose the way you would like to run the application. 
If you would like to run it through the simulators press `a` for android and `i` for iOS.
If you would like to run it on your personal phone, scan the QR code and it should then open on your phone.
